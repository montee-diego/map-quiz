Making SVG interactive
Panning and Zooming
Handle click and touch events in JS
Map logic resides in one JS file and it works on any map that can be added easily

Technical:
detect mouse and touch events separately
detect one finger for pan and 2 fingers (pinch gesture) to zoom
automatic detection of touch / mouse detection on same device (laptops with touchscreen ie)
